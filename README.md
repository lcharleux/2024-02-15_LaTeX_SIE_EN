# Introduction to LaTeX
(SIE Doctoral school)

## Introduction


$\LaTeX$ is an open source (and therefore free) tool that allows to produce high quality written documents. It has a wide range of applications in the humanities, economic and social sciences and exact and engineering sciences. It allows an easy and very clean management of mathematical formulas, figures or bibliography. The module provides participants with the knowledge and practice of this tool that allows them to concentrate on the organization and meaning of what they want to convey, with the computer and the typographic expertise of $\LaTeX$ taking care of the rest. $\LaTeX$ also works naturally with GIT and allows you to follow the evolution of your document and to collaborate easily with others.
